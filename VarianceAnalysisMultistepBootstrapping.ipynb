    "# Variance Analysis in Multistep Bootstrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand the $Q(\\sigma)$ algorithm better, we will analyze and compare its performance to other multistep bootstrapping methods. Since $Q(\\sigma)$ is tied to the off policy n-step tree backup algorithm, we thus compare it to the off-policy variants of n-step SARSA, n-step expected SARSA, and to the n-step tree backup algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About bootstrapping multistep methods:\n",
    "As [1] notes, bootstrapping methods work best when applied over multiple time steps, such that a significant and recognizable state change can be observed. From [1] also, note that multistep methods are usually associated with eligibility traces, but in this benchmark we consider only the multistep component of these algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithmic Theoretical Background\n",
    "### Off-policy N-step SARSA and N-step expected SARSA [1]\n",
    "The regular SARSA(0) algorithm learns the value of state-action pairs and, after each transition from a nonterminal state $S_t$ applies the update equation:\n",
    "$$ Q(S,A) \\leftarrow Q(S,A) + \\alpha [ R + \\gamma Q(S', A') - Q(S,A)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In off-policy n-step SARSA, we still learn the value of state-action pairs but only update our estimate after $n$ steps, weighing the update using the importance sampling ratio $\\rho_{t}^{t+n}$ defined as the relative probability under the two policies of taking the n actions from $A_t$ to $A_{t+n-1}$:\n",
    "$$\\rho_t^{t+n} = \\prod_{k=t}^{min(t+n-1, T-1)}  \\frac{\\pi(A_k|S_k)}{\\mu(A_k|S_k)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "And we use the update equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Q_{t+n}(S_t,A_t) = Q_{t+n-1}(S_t,A_t) + \\alpha \\rho_{t+1}^{t+n} [ G_t^{(n)} - Q_{t+n-1}(S_t,A_t)] $$\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For off-policy n-step expected SARSA, we simply change the computation of the n-step return to:\n",

We thus go on to consider the state and actions that follow from having taken that action at time $t$, until $n$ steps have been exhausted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that each of the action values of the possible actions at a specific state gets weighted by its probability of being taken, with the taken action weighing the whole tree underneath it (= all the possible actions originating from having taken that action).

    "[1] thus generalizes the TD error $\\delta_t$ to be a function of $\\sigma$:\n",
    "$$\\delta_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma[\\sigma_{t+1}Q_{t}(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1}) + (1-\\sigma_{t+1}) V_{t+1}] - Q_{t-1}(S_t, A_t)$$\n",

    "# Brief Variance Theoretical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Off-Policy vs. On-Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with analyzing the variance in off-policy methods vs. on-policy methods. From [1], we know that for off-policy learning, importance sampling \"enables off-policy learning, but at the cost of increasing the variance of the updates.\" While weighted importance sampling [2] or adapative importance sampling (based on previous timestep variance) [3,6] can bring down this variance, typical n-step off-policy SARSA does not use this variance reduction technique as described in [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Rid of Importance Sampling (n-step Tree Backup)\n",
    "\n",
    "In [4], where n-step Tree Backup is first introduced (without importance sampling in Section 4 of [4]), the authors bypass importance sampling by using backups from possible actions at each step combined with the probability of the target policy taking this action. This removes importance sampling and theoretically the variance introduced by it. Intuitively, this is the same bias-variance tradeoff as in Expected Sarsa. By using the expectation at each timestep we are bounding the variance (see [5] for more details on bias-variance tradeoff of Sarsa vs. Expected SARSA). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Combining Importance Sampling with Expecation in Tree Backup (i.e. n-step $Q(\\sigma)$)\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding function which balances sampling with the expectation backups of n-step tree backup, we can balance the variance. One can think of an easy extension such that the $\\sigma$ provided to the algorithm is a function of the previous step's variance (similar to adaptive importance sampling or autostep [3,6]). However, say that we simply choose the $\\sigma$ value to be a uniformly distributed random variable. TODO: maths here???\n",
    "\n",
    "## Effect of n on variance??\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partial Sketch of Variance Analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We think our analysis here is outside the scope of the assignment, but we include some of our partial derivations regardless for those that might be interested in completing them with us.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in [5], we formulate the variance of n-step Sarsa as follows. Take $v_t = \\rho \\left[ G_t^{(n)} - Q_{t+n-1}(S_t, A_t) \\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then expand the variance term as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Var(s,a) = E \\left\\{ (v_t)^2 \\right\\} - (E \\left\\{ v_t \\right\\} )^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring the second term for now:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Var(s,a) = E \\left\\{ \\rho^2 G_t^{(n)} + Q_{t+n-1}^2(s_t, a_t) - 2 \\rho G_t^{(n)} Q_{t+n-1}(s_t, a_t) \\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $G_t^{(n)} = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\gamma^{k-1} R_{t+k} + \\gamma^n \\sum_a \\pi(a | s_{t+n}) Q_{t+n-1}(s_t, a)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for n-step tree backup: $v_t = \\left[ \\hat{G}_t^{(n)} - Q_{t+n-1}(S_t, A_t) \\right]$, where $$\\hat{G}_t^{(n)} = Q_{t-1}(S_t, A_t) + \\sum_{k=t}^{min(t+n-1, T-1)}\\delta_k \\prod_{i=t+1}^{k} \\gamma \\pi(A_i | S_i)$$\n",
    "and $$\\delta_t = R_{t+1} + \\gamma V_{t+1} - Q_{t-1}(S_t, A_t)$$ and $V_{t+1} = \\sum_{a} \\pi(a|S_{t+1}) Q(S_{t+1}, a)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for n-strep tree backup the variance becomes partially (ignoring the $(E \\left\\{ v_t \\right\\} )^2$ term for now:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Var(s,a) = E \\left\\{\\hat{G}_t^{(n)} + Q_{t+n-1}^2(s_t, a_t) - 2 \\hat{G}_t^{(n)} Q_{t+n-1}(s_t, a_t) \\right \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to time we don't continue the derivations, but partially, we know that a main difference between the two terms is the importance sampling. We suggest that by expansion (reflecting what emperical evidence suggests in [2,4]), we expect that Sarsa will have higher variance when the $\\rho$ term is larger (i.e. when importance sampling plays a larger role in the terms the difference in variance between tree backup, where there is no importance sampling, and n-step sarsa, where there is, will be larger).\n"

    "For all our algorithms, we have used a discount factor $\\gamma = 0.9$.  \n",

    "## Experimental results\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we first examine the effect of varying $\\alpha$, the learning rate on the average reward, the variance in average Q values, and the variance in obtained reward. As we've seen previously (see [Analysis of the bias variance tradeoff in SARSA variants](https://github.com/Breakend/SarsaVsExpectedSarsa/blob/master/BiasVarianceTradeoff.ipynb)), most algorithms suffer from a higher variance in average Q values, leading to a lower average reward, as the learning rate increases.  \n",
    "Again we expect here to see n-step expected Sarsa having lower Q variance and higher average reward than n-step sarsa. We also expect the n-step tree backup algorithm to have a lower Q variance than all other algorithms as it doesn't use importance sampling. And, we expect the $Q(\\sigma)$ algorithm to have a Q variance that is in-between the Q variance obtained for n-step expected Sarsa and tree backup as it uses a uniform random variable to balance the two.  \n",

    "As we can see in the figure above, the variance in the average Q value increases as expected for all algorithms. \n",
    "The average Q variance is highest and increases the most for n-step Sarsa as expected, while the other algorithms do not suffer as much from increasing the $\\alpha$ value.  \n",
    "Confirming our hypothesis, the n-step expected Sarsa algorithm obtains a lower average Q variance compared to Sarsa and is bounded below by n-step $Q(\\sigma)$, which itself is bounded below by the lowest average Q variance algorithm, n-step tree backup.\n",
